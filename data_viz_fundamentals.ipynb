    "\n",
    "Preattentive processing refers to tasks that your brain can perform less than 250 ms after your eyes detect a multi-element display.\n",

    "2. What are some examples of preattentive visual features?\n",
    "\n",
    "A few examples of preattentive visual features are size, shape, and color.\n",

    "3. What happens to preattentive processing when there are multiple such features in the same image?\n",
    "\n",
    "When there are multiple such features, preattentive processing can become slower or impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the theory of the feature hierarchy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature hierarchy is the idea that certain features are prioritized over others."
