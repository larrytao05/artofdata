# Designing Experiments

## Review
1. What is the difference between **independent** and **dependent** variables?

Independent variables change during the experiment / are modified by the researcher, while dependent variables change based on independent variables.

2. What is the difference between a **null** and **alternative** hypothesis?

repeat

3. How/why can experimental studies show causation?


Experimental studies can hold all variables constant except for the one that is being tested for causation, therefore showing whether it causes something else or not.

## Running Experiments
1. How/why can experimental studies show causation?
2. How might sampling bias affect the results of an experiment?

Sampling bias can affect the percentages of entries with a certain trait, therefore affecting how those entries react to certain independent variables.

3. What might go wrong while conducting an experiment?

Variables can be uncontrolled unintentionally, data can be lost, modified, or deleted, and the physical experiment itself can run into issues. 

## Designing an Experiment
1. Put these steps in the correct order:
     - Ask a precise question
     - Do background research
     - Identify null and alternative hypotheses
     - Identify population
     - Choose sampling method
     - Identify sample frame
     - Obtain sample to include in experiment
     - Identify independent and dependent variables
     - Identify **treatments**
     - Conduct treatments on **control** and **experimental** groups

2. What are some examples of how an experiment can go wrong? Refer to specific steps from the list above.

Background research can be incorrect / invalid
Sampling frame can be biased

3. How might an error affect the trustworthiness of a study? How much *should* an error affect the trustworthiness of a study?

An error can completely invalidate the results of the study because it changes the results of the study.

4. What might a scientist do to prevent such errors?

Work with other researchers, double check decisions that are made, review data.

5. What does it mean to **double blind** a study?

It means that neither the researchers nor the participants know the treatment they are recieving until the end of the study.
