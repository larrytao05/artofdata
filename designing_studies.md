# Designing Studies

## Review
1. What is the difference between a sample and a population?

A sample is a small group that represents the overall population, while a population is every individual of a certain type of group.

## Types of Studies
1. What is the difference between an **observational** and an **experimental** study?

An observational study is one performed without interacting with an environment, while an experimental study attempts to create an environment and then analyze the results.

2. What is meant by the phrase "correlation, not causation"? Take a look at [Tyler Vigen's spurious correlations](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) for some examples.

Correlation is relating two trends that are similar without showing that they depend on each other.

3. Why can't an observational study show causation?

An observational study doesn't control independent and dependent variables, and as a result cannot actually show that two things that correlate cause each other.

4. What reasons might a researcher have for choosing one type of study over another?

If using a specific type of study changes the likelihood of a research paper being published, that might motivate a researcher to use that type of study. It might also be more financially advantageous to use a specific type of study.

## Sample Frame
1. What is a **sample frame**, and how is that different from a sample?

The sample frame is the list or dataset from which a sample is obtained. 

2. What does **coverage bias** (also called **exclusion bias**) mean in the context of choosing a sample frame?

It would mean that the sample frame is not equal to the population, meaning that there are group(s) of people that have no chances of showing up in the sample.

3. Suppose a researcher were studying the population of all students at Horace Mann.
   1. Give an example of a sample frame that demonstrates coverage bias.

A list of all students in the 12th grade.

   2. What reasons might the researcher have for choosing that sample frame?

If the researcher is trying to show a correlation between going to HM and an increase in stress levels, using only the 12th grade would likely show a higher correlation because 12th graders have more work than those in other grades.

   3. What could the researcher do to reduce coverage bias?

   They could use multiple sample frames and cross-reference them, or check a sample frame with members of the actual population (if applicable).

## Sampling Methodology
1. What does it mean for a sample to be "good"?

It means that the sample approaches or is essentially representative of the population and is chosen at random.

2. What is the difference between **probability** and **nonprobability** sampling?

Nonprobability sampling is when the researcher manually, subjectively chooses a sample from the frame, while probability sampling is randomized based on the frequencies that certain groups show up in the sample frame.

3. Give two examples of nonprobability sampling. What biases might these methods be prone to?

A researcher manually selecting only people who exhibit a certain trait.

A researcher selecting the first 200 entries in a sample frame as the sample.


4. Give two examples of probability sampling. What biases might these methods be prone to?

## Practice
Choose one of the following situations:
  - A 3rd grade teacher is interested in childhood literacy development. Theyâ€™ve noticed that some students tend to perform better when asked to do reading tasks. The teacher is curious about what reading activities these students are doing at home.
  - An outdoor enthusiast recently went hiking, and found that some blueberries on the side of the trail were extremely sweet. However, other bushes on the same trail produced tasteless blueberries. The hiker is intrigued by what could be causing this difference.
  - An independent publisher is looking at printing presses to partner with. They are focused on newspapers and want to find a company that is experienced with newsprint paper. The publisher is thinking about what qualities to look for.

Then, for your chosen situation, write a response to the following:
1. Identify a statistical question you could ask in that situation.

What percent of students that perform above the average on reading tasks do reading at home or outside of school?

2. Identify the population you would study to answer the question. What information about the population would help answer your question?



3. Identify a feasible sample frame, and explain your reasoning.
4. Identify the sampling method you would use, and explain your reasoning. What makes this method better than the others?
5. What biases may come up, and how would you address them?
