# Different Types of Data

## CS Types of Data
We've talked about different types of data before when thinking about writing code. Let's review what *type* means in the context of computer science.

1. What are some different types of data you've worked with? _Hint: what's a class?_

Int, String, Double, Digimon, etc

2. What happens if you try to average a list of strings?

The operand type is not supported

3. Why is a variable's type important?

It restricts the operations / functions that can be run on a variable and classifies data based on certain characteristics


## Statistical Types of Data
In statistics, a variable's type means something different compared to what we've seen in computer science.

1. What is a statistical variable, and how is it different from a computer science variable?

A statistical variable is something in an experiment or research study that changes. A computer science variable is simply a piece of data.

2. Why is a statistical variable's type important?

It signifies how the variable changes and its significance in the study.

### Vocabulary
I encourage you to search online for these answers! Try to respond in your own words.
1. What is the difference between a **quantitative** and a **qualitative** variable?

Quantitative data is data that can be represented numerically, while qualitative data cannot.

2. What is the difference between a **discrete** and a **continuous** variable? Are these quantitative or qualitative?

Discrete variables have a finite number of possibilities for their values, while continous variables have a certain range that contains an infinite number of possible values. They are quantitative variables.

3. What is the difference between a **nominal** and an **ordinal** variable? Are these quantitative or qualitative?

Nominal variables are simply named and labelled, while ordinal variables are not only named and labelled, but are also given a specific order. They are qualitative variables.

4. What is a qualitative variable that's not **categorical**?



### Application
1. A researcher is studying childrenâ€™s favorite colors. They label each color with a number -- for example, they record red as 1, blue as 2, green as 3, and so on. Later on, when they are analyzing their data, they find that the average favorite color is 2.78, and conclude that children like the color blue-green. Discuss the issues that led to this erroneous conclusion.

The numbers that are assigned to each color are arbitrary, and there is also no connection between a person liking red, for example, and another person liking blue. As a result, you cannot perform a quantitative action on the data.

2. A researcher is studying student burnout. What questions might they want to ask, and what data would they record? What are possible analyses of this data, and how do those analyses depend on the data types?

You could record quantitative data, for example, like hours a student can concentrate for, etc. You could also record qualitative data, like the student's opinion on the workload, etc. So one possible analysis of the data is to record both of those examples, and then relate the ability of the student to concentrate in each class with their opinion on the workload.
